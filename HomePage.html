    <h2>Synospis</h2>
      <p>One of Marvel’s greatest and most complex characters takes center stage as Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) becomes
         the host for the alien symbiote Venom. As a journalist, Eddie has been trying to take down the notorious founder
         of the Life Foundation, genius Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed) – and that obsession ruined his career and his relationship
         with his girlfriend, Anne Weying (Michelle Williams). Upon investigating one of Drake’s experiments,
         the alien Venom merges with Eddie’s body, and he suddenly has incredible new superpowers,
         as well as the chance to do just about whatever he wants. Twisted, dark, unpredictable, and fueled by rage,
         Venom leaves Eddie wrestling to control dangerous abilities that he also finds empowering and intoxicating.
         As Eddie and Venom need each other to get what they’re looking for,
         they become more and more intertwined — where does Eddie end and Venom begin?</p>
