         The <center> element has been deprecated. If you want to centre things, you should use css instead.

         To centre an image, you should put it in a full-width element, like a <div>, and then set the text-align
         property of that container element to center. For example:

          <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="image/myphoto.jpg" alt="myphoto">
          </div>
          *** -->

<p>Hi! My name is Martyna Szwałek. I am 19 and come from Poland. I have a younger brother - Igor. My passion is horse riding and drawing. I came to this course by accident because I have never had any contact with any of the skills that I am learning now. However, it was my best decision in life because the first time "learning" gives me pleasure.</p>

<h2>My Favourite Place in the World</h2>
    
<!-- ***
     Centring videos is trickier. To be honest, it's a bit of a hack that images respond to text-align. 

     Anyhow, to centre a video, or most other elements actually, you need to set the left and right margins to a value of 'auto'.

     This will make them automatically expand by the same amount, resulting in the element being held in the centre. For example:

     <video style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" controls width="30%">
        <source src="vid/video.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
        <source src="vid/video.ogv type="video/ogg" />
        <source src="vid/video.webm" type="video/webm" />
        <p>Fallback</p>
     </video>

     You might have noticed there that I didn't put controls="true". If you are setting an attribute to true, simply 
     including its name does the job.

     One last thing - On the middle <source> element, you've got src="vid/video.ogv. You've forgotten to put a closing " after the .ogv.
     *** -->

<center><video controls="true"; width="30%">
  <source src="vid/video.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  <source src="vid/video.ogv type="video/ogg" />
  <source src="vid/video.webm" type="video/webm" />
  <p>Your browser does not support the video element. Please click <a href='vid/video.mp4'>here</a> to download an mp4 of the video.</p>

     I think you've got a little confusion over the headings <h1> to <h6>.
     The number isn't meant to keep increasing as you go down the page - it doesn't denote the order. 
     The number represents the relative importance of the heading. Your main heading "About Me" is a <h1>, which
     is great as it's the main heading. All other headings are sub-headings, all equally imporance, so they 
     should all be <h2> elements.
