<h1>About Me</h1>
<center><img src="image/myphoto.jpg" alt="myphoto"></center>
<p>Hi! My name is Martyna Szwałek. I am 19 and come from Poland. I have a younger brother - Igor. My passion is horse riding and drawing. I came to this course by accident because I have never had any contact with any of the skills that I am learning now. However, it was my best decision in life because the first time "learning" gives me pleasure.</p>
